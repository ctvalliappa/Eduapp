				Education Assistance program provides scholarships to needy
				Nagarathar students to help with higher education expenses. Funds
				are generated through various fund raising programs in North America
				and through voluntary contributions of generous Nagarathars
				worldwide, both members and non-members of NSNA. Please note that
				interest from existing endowment funds are no longer sufficient to
				support educational assistance, so all donations are directly
				applied to assist individual students.

				going children at this time. We ONLY provide scholarships to college
				admitted candidates.</p>
